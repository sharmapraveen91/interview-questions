3. **What is `DisposableEffect` used for in Jetpack Compose? Can you provide an example?**
   - Define `DisposableEffect` and explain when and why you would use it.

4. **What is the difference between `remember` and `rememberUpdatedState` in Jetpack Compose?**
   - Discuss the purpose and behavior of `remember` and `rememberUpdatedState` in Compose.

5. **When would you use `SideEffect` in Jetpack Compose?**
   - Explain scenarios where `SideEffect` is appropriate and give examples.

## **Intermediate Level**

6. **How does `LaunchedEffect` handle recomposition in Jetpack Compose?**
   - Discuss what happens to `LaunchedEffect` when the key changes or when the composable is recomposed.

7. **What is the `rememberCoroutineScope` function used for, and how does it differ from `LaunchedEffect`?**
   - Clarify the distinction between `rememberCoroutineScope` and `LaunchedEffect` in terms of usage and behavior.

8. **How do you ensure resource cleanup in Jetpack Compose when using side effects?**
   - Explain the role of `DisposableEffect` in cleanup tasks, and describe the `onDispose` callback.

9. **Explain how `derivedStateOf` works in Jetpack Compose. How does it improve performance?**
   - Discuss the behavior of `derivedStateOf` and why it prevents unnecessary recompositions.

10. **What happens if the `key` parameter of `LaunchedEffect` changes?**
    - Detail the lifecycle of `LaunchedEffect` and the effect of key changes.

## **Advanced Level**

11. **When would you choose `snapshotFlow` over other side effect APIs in Jetpack Compose?**
    - Explain scenarios where `snapshotFlow` is more suitable than `LaunchedEffect` or `SideEffect`.

12. **What are the key differences between `LaunchedEffect` and `produceState`? In which use cases would you prefer one over the other?**
    - Compare `LaunchedEffect` and `produceState` in terms of their purpose, lifecycle, and when each should be used.

13. **What happens if you call `LaunchedEffect` multiple times with the same key in Jetpack Compose?**
    - Describe how multiple calls to `LaunchedEffect` with the same key behave in terms of cancelling and launching coroutines.

14. **Can you give an example where `rememberUpdatedState` would solve a potential bug or performance issue in a Compose UI?**
    - Share a real-world example where using `rememberUpdatedState` prevents an issue like outdated state in callback functions.

15. **Explain how you would manage state synchronization between `produceState`, `LaunchedEffect`, and a ViewModel in Jetpack Compose.**
    - Discuss an approach for managing complex state between Compose, side effects, and a ViewModel.

16. **What is the importance of using `onDispose` in `DisposableEffect`? Can you give an example of improper cleanup and its consequences?**
    - Explain the critical importance of disposing resources (e.g., listeners, subscriptions) properly in Compose to prevent memory leaks.

17. **How does Jetpack Compose handle concurrency when using `rememberCoroutineScope` and `LaunchedEffect` together in the same Composable?**
    - Explore potential concurrency issues and how Jetpack Compose ensures safe usage of multiple coroutines.

18. **What is the difference in lifecycle management between `SideEffect` and `LaunchedEffect`?**
    - Clarify the specific lifecycle considerations for `SideEffect` (runs after composition) vs `LaunchedEffect` (runs during composition).

19. **In which cases would you prefer using `produceState` over `remember` and why?**
    - Discuss when `produceState` is more appropriate than using `remember` for holding state, especially in asynchronous operations.

20. **How would you handle dynamic state changes in `derivedStateOf`?**
    - Explain how `derivedStateOf` recalculates and recomposes the UI only when necessary.

21. **What performance optimizations do `derivedStateOf` and `snapshotFlow` offer in comparison to regular `remember`?**
    - Discuss how these APIs improve performance by limiting unnecessary recompositions or updates to state.

## **Scenario-Based Questions**

22. **Imagine you have a Composable that triggers an API call when a button is clicked. The API response should update the UI. How would you implement this using side effects?**
    - Walk through how you'd implement this feature using `LaunchedEffect`, `rememberCoroutineScope`, or a combination of both.

23. **You have a Composable with multiple state variables. Some of these states are derived from others, and you want to optimize recomposition. How would you handle this?**
    - Discuss how you would use `derivedStateOf` to optimize state updates and recomposition.

24. **You need to display a progress indicator when a long-running task (like file upload) is in progress. How would you manage this state and handle cleanup using Jetpack Compose side effects?**
    - Talk about how you might use `LaunchedEffect` or `DisposableEffect` to handle the progress state and clean up the task when it completes.

25. **In a complex Composable, you are fetching data asynchronously from an API, and the UI should respond immediately once the data is available. How would you approach this in Jetpack Compose?**
    - Explain how `produceState` or `LaunchedEffect` would be useful for this use case, depending on the specific scenario.

26. **How would you implement an action that should run only once when the Composable is first shown on the screen, such as showing an onboarding message, using Compose side effects?**
    - Suggest using `LaunchedEffect` or `SideEffect` for triggering this one-time action.

27. **You need to display a message every time the `count` state variable changes, but only after the composable has been composed. How would you do this?**
    - Talk about using `SideEffect` to log or show messages after composition.

## **Conceptual and Theoretical Questions**

28. **What do you mean by "side effects in UI programming"? Why is it important to handle them correctly in Jetpack Compose?**
    - Explain the broader concept of side effects in UI programming and why improper handling can lead to issues like inconsistent UI or performance problems.

29. **What is the Compose lifecycle, and how does it relate to managing side effects effectively?**
    - Discuss the lifecycle of a composable and how side effects should align with it to ensure correctness and performance.

30. **How would you debug a situation where a side effect isnâ€™t being triggered or isn't working as expected in Jetpack Compose?**
    - Share your approach to debugging side effects, including checking recompositions, key changes, and lifecycle events.
